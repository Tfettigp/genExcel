# genExcel
A small sample of Importing to Excel. Expand to make useful.


What I would like to see added to this is the ability to :

 1   Connect to a SQL Server named lo-parser\liveopticsparse Windows authentication
 2	Use the Avamar database
 3	Select * from dbo.v_clientperftrack â€“ this is a view that will return strings, numbers and dates attached is schema for view
 4	Create workbook with two sheets , one populated with the columns from this view the other blank.
